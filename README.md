# Smart Identity

This project was undertaken during my internship at Sonatel Senegal and is being presented as a partial fulfillment of my Master II program at [AIMS Senegal](https://aims-senegal.org/). The project involves the digitization of the ECOWAS identity card utilizing OCR techniques.

Please note that, due to Sonatel's ownership, the complete code and model cannot be shared as open source. The provided streamlit app serves solely as a demonstration of my accomplishments. The app showcases the classification of ID cards exclusively.
